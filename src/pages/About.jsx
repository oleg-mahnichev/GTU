        About us We are a team with experience in international procurement,
        logistics and contract support. Our goal is to establish effective
        cooperation between German companies and suppliers from Ukraine and
        other Eastern European countries. We offer an individual approach to
        each client, help to find the best partners, and provide support at all
        stages of cooperation: from the first contact to the delivery of goods.
        We work in Ukrainian, German, English and Russian. We understand local
        markets and mentalities, which allows us to act quickly and efficiently.
